# Red-Sky-Report
This project is a web-based application that provides real-time weather and temperature updates, alongside an interactive 3D model of Mars. It was developed by me and my teammate as part of a hackathon challenge focused on space and data visualization.

Key Features:

🌡️ Live/Simulated Weather Data: Displays temperature and atmospheric data relevant to Mars or Earth.

🛰️ 3D Mars Model: A fully interactive 3D visualization of Mars, allowing users to explore its surface.

💻 Responsive Design: Works smoothly across devices for a seamless user experience.

🧠 Built with Passion: Designed and developed collaboratively during the hackathon under tight deadlines, showcasing creativity, technical skills, and teamwork.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3D Rendering: Three.js (or whichever library you used)

APIs: 3D model of mars from Sketchfab
